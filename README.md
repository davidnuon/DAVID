# DAVID
A tool for interactive visual exploration of complex linked data. 

DAVID uses component based visualization to allow for creative development and exploration of complex, linked data in a web environment. It is capable of visualizing big data on demand and creating multi-machine visualizations via event synchronization between machines. Visual components are extendable and running in their own logical containers. Seperation of concerns is enforced bia language seperation. Programming against DAVID as a designer require Javscript knowledge and your vis library of choice. The logic of the application is written in googles DART language.

### Running DAVID
* You will require Dartium to run DAVID. Make sure you run a pub install before starting the system.
* The nativ shell (access to OS files and pSQL) is written in node and located in the core data package. Fire up shell.js to get access to critical resources (again, this is OS level and can harm your system, depending on you extensions).

###What is DAVID (Dynamic Analysis and Visualization of Interconnected Data) ?
In the age of big data, very large sets of different measurable data are permanently acquired. However, the development of efficient methodology to search for and identify the actual information hidden in large data sets, and to explore relationships between sub-datasets, is lagging behing. Data visualization is an efficient and intuitively accessible approach to identify patterns in large and diverse data sets. State-of-the-art computing provides the enabling technology to visualize data not only as static images but also in interactive visualizations. But even the most efficient and powerful data visualization tools do not satisfactorily address and exploit the possibilities of interactive data analysis. They constrain creativity and are often complex to use. We propose to use "component based visualization" for interactive data exploration. Component based visualization derives properties such as "composability" and "information hiding" from the concept of a software component and transfers them to the domain of data visualization. By building a directed graph of such components, a complex set of visualizations can be composed. The dataset of a component itself can then be used as a parameter to define the semantics of an arc between two components (e.g. two visualizations can be connected to show the same GPS coordinate from different data recordings, thus allowing the comparison of other associated data, such as a heart rate).

Additionally, users are allowed to not only interact with the visualization but also alter data processing and visualization by a component. This approach allows simulataneous exploration of multiple datasets applying various criteria, while comprising the relationships between the data. This concept is showcased through a visualization system that allows the user not only to dive into data via visualizations, but facilitates the creative freedom to build, extend and define new visualizations and their composition. The prototype, called DAVID (dynamic analysis and visualization of integrated data), is a tool for interactive exploration of linked data.
